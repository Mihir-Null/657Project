{\clm{
\textbf{Weakly triply-even} (\textsc{TE*}) codes derived from quadratic-residue constructions will achieve strictly better \emph{finite-size overhead} than both generic \textbf{doubled self-dual} constructions and the standard \textbf{Bravyi--Haah triorthogonal} distillation codes due to their high distances in $n$-qubit codes for small $n$, structure inherited from QR code weight distributions, and exceptionally low-weight X-stabilizers while still satisfying necessary triorthogonality conditions.
